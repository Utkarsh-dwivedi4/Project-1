# Project-1
# My First GitHub Repository 🚀

This is my first repository on GitHub!  
I'm excited to start my journey in coding and version control.  
Here, I will be experimenting with code, learning Git, and pushing my first commits.

👨‍💻 Skills I'm learning:  
- Git & GitHub  
- Programming languages (like Python or C)  
- Project structure and documentation

Stay tuned for updates as I grow my skills! 🌱
